# Problem set 3 testing file -- for multiple sources and sinks
created node n1 with cost 10
created node n3 with cost 1
created graph A
added node n1 to A
created node n2 with cost 5
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added edge from n3 to n1 in A
added edge from n3 to n2 in A
shortest path in A: n3 n2
dfs algorithm output A n1 -> n2: no path was found
dfs algorithm output A n3 -> n2: n3 n2 with cost 2
found path in A: n3 n2 with cost 2
